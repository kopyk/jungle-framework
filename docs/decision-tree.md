## Decision Tree: Your Visual Macro Guide

This page contains **two decision trees**:
1. **Early Game (Levels 1–6)** — establishing tempo and information  
2. **Midgame** — converting information into objectives and trades  

Each tree can be followed every game.

---

## How to Use These Trees

- **Iron–Silver**: Follow arrows exactly
- **Gold–Platinum**: Add minimap and summoner checks
- **Diamond+**: Evaluate each branch by information, risk, and tempo

**Global rules**
- One jungle camp = **4 CS**
- Full clear is the default
- Check minimap every ~5 seconds
- Never let the enemy jungler gain value for free

# Early Game Decision Tree (Levels 1–6)

![Early game jungle decision tree](/img/decision-tree-early.svg)

*Figure 1. Early-game jungle decision tree (Levels 1–6).*

### Breakdown

- **Level 1 Ward**  
  Reveals ~80% of jungle paths through leash and camp timing.

- **Priority Check**  
  Use lane states (push, matchup, summoners) — see *Decision Rules*.

- **Full Clear Default**  
  Safe baseline for most champions (e.g., Rammus, Yi).

- **Tempo Loop**  
  Every branch ends in a reset → re-enter the tree.

### Early Game Principles

- Unknown enemy path → **full clear + vision**
- Failed gank → **do not force**, return to farm
- Always exit the tree with **tempo**, not desperation

<details>
<summary><strong>When should you skip full clear early?</strong></summary>

Only skip a full clear when:
- A lane is immediately gankable
- You have lane priority to support it
- You know where the enemy jungler is

Otherwise, default to full clear and re-evaluate at Scuttle.

# Midgame Decision Tree

![Midgame jungle decision tree](/img/decision-tree-mid.svg)

*Figure 2. Midgame jungle decision tree (Post–Level 6).*

### Breakdown

- **Enemy Path Known?**  
  Based on vision, CS tracking, or recent map appearance.

- **Your Side vs Their Side**  
  Determines countergank vs invade logic.

- **Objective Check**  
  Every play should connect to an objective or trade.

- **Cross-Map Rule**  
  Enemy pressure on one side → gain value on the other.

### Midgame Principles

- Counterganks often outperform proactive ganks
- Objectives are **exchanges**, not isolated goals
- If you cannot contest → **trade immediately**

<details>
<summary><strong>Enemy jungler ganks top — what now?</strong></summary>

Do not chase late.

Instead:
- Start or threaten **Drake**
- Invade **enemy bot-side camps**
- Pressure mid or bot tower

The goal is to deny free value and out-trade the play.

## Rank-Specific Usage

| Rank | Focus |
|-----|------|
| **Iron–Gold** | Use Early Game tree only. Full clear when unsure. |
| **Platinum–Diamond** | Add invade and countergank branches (≥70% HP rule). |
| **Master+** | Score every branch by **Information → Risk → Tempo**. |

---

## Practice Drills

- **Custom games**: Walk the Early Game tree 5 times, timing clears
- **Normals**: Verbalize your branch choice out loud
- **VOD review**: Pause and ask, *“Which branch applies here?”*

Mastery comes from repetition, not memorization.
