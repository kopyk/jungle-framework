## Common Mistakes in Jungling

This page documents **systematic jungle mistakes** that lose games silently.  
Each mistake includes a **cause**, a **why it fails**, and a **framework fix**.

The goal is not perfection — it is **eliminating repeatable errors**.

---

## 1. Ganking Without Lane Priority

**What it looks like**
- Ganking lanes that are neutral or pushing away
- Forcing plays because “it feels gankable”

**Why it fails**
- No follow-up damage or CC
- Enemy jungler arrives first
- You lose tempo even if no one dies

**Framework fix**
> If the lane is not pushed, the gank is *borrowed tempo*.

Default to farming or hovering until priority exists.

---

## 2. Ignoring Your Own Lane States

**What it looks like**
- Farming while a lane is clearly diveable
- Showing up late to fights that were predictable

**Why it fails**
- You react instead of anticipate
- Enemy converts pressure into kills

**Framework fix**
> Volatile lanes demand presence.

If a lane looks unstable, assume interaction is imminent and position accordingly.

## 3. Letting the Enemy Jungler Get Value for Free

**What it looks like**
- Enemy ganks top, you keep farming your camps
- Enemy takes Drake, no cross-map response

**Why it fails**
- Gold and tempo gap compounds
- You lose control of the game flow

**Framework fix**
> Every enemy action must be answered.

Kills ↔ camps  
Objectives ↔ towers  
Pressure ↔ information  

If you cannot contest, **trade immediately**.

## 4. Forcing Ganks After a Failed Attempt

**What it looks like**
- Re-ganking a lane that already failed
- Chasing sunk cost (“I’m already here”)

**Why it fails**
- Enemy wards reset
- Cooldowns are unavailable
- Enemy jungler is now tracking you

**Framework fix**
> A failed gank ends the branch.

Return to farm, reset tempo, and re-enter the decision tree cleanly.

---

## 5. Skipping Full Clears Without Information

**What it looks like**
- Random 2–3 camp paths
- Early roaming without vision or prio

**Why it fails**
- Level disadvantage
- Inconsistent gold income
- Increased variance

**Framework fix**
> Full clear is the default unless information justifies deviation.

If you cannot explain *why* you skipped camps, you probably shouldn’t have.

---

## 6. Overvaluing Kills

**What it looks like**
- Chasing kills instead of pushing waves
- Ignoring objectives after successful fights

**Why it fails**
- Kills without conversion = wasted tempo
- Enemy catches up through farm

**Framework fix**
> Kills are a tool, not an objective.

Every kill should lead to:
- A reset
- A camp steal
- An objective
- Vision control

## How to Use This Page

After each loss, ask:
- Which mistake did I repeat?
- Which rule or tree branch would have prevented it?

Fixing **one mistake at a time** is enough to climb consistently.
