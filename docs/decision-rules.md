## Decision-Making Principles (How to Apply the Rules)

The checklists above determine *whether* an action is allowed.  
The principles below explain *how to recognize opportunities earlier* and *how to avoid giving value away for free*.

These principles become increasingly important as you climb.

---

### Read Your Own Lane States First

Before evaluating a gank, evaluate **your own lanes**.

- A pushed enemy lane indicates **vulnerability**
- A neutral lane indicates **low reliability**
- A pushed allied lane often signals **countergank risk**

Looking at your own lane states first prevents forced ganks and helps you anticipate where fights are *about to happen*, not where they already happened.

> If a lane looks volatile, assume interaction is imminent.

---

### Counterganking Converts Enemy Pressure Into Advantage

Counterganks are often **higher value than proactive ganks**, especially when:

- Your laner is pushed or low HP
- The enemy jungler is missing
- A dive or forced play is likely

By hovering vulnerable lanes instead of farming blindly, you can:
- Turn losing fights
- Secure double kills
- Gain tempo without committing first

At higher levels, junglers win games by **being present**, not by starting fights.

---

### Never Allow the Enemy Jungler to Gain Value for Free

Every enemy action must be answered.

If the enemy jungler gains:
- **Kills** → you must gain **camps, vision, or objectives**
- **Objectives** → you must gain **pressure elsewhere**
- **Time** → you must gain **information**

> The only losing play is doing nothing.

Even partial trades (2 camps for a kill) reduce variance and prevent snowballing.

---

### Cross-Map Trading at Higher Levels

As skill increases, trades become **symmetric**, not reactive.

- Enemy ganks top → you invade bot or start Drake
- Enemy commits to bot dive → you pressure Herald or mid tower
- Enemy takes Baron → you take inhibitors or force fights

At higher ranks, jungling becomes a **resource exchange**, not a series of isolated plays.

> You do not need to match plays — you need to *out-trade them*.

---

### Kills Are a Tool, Not the Objective

Kills matter because they:
- Create tempo
- Remove pressure
- Enable objectives

They are **not** valuable in isolation.

A kill that does not lead to:
- A reset
- A camp steal
- An objective
- Vision control

…is often lower value than a clean full clear.

## How These Principles Scale

- **Iron–Gold**: Focus on lane states and avoiding free losses
- **Platinum–Diamond**: Prioritize counterganks and cross-map responses
- **Master+**: Evaluate every play as an exchange of tempo, risk, and information

Mastery comes from recognizing *why* a rule applies, not just *when*.
