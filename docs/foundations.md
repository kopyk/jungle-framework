## First Clears: The Top-Down Approach

**Master+ Principle:**  
Every champion has an *optimal first clear* tailored to their kit (e.g., Yi: Red start → Meditate sustain for speed). However, the **standard full clear** (all 6 camps) is *more than sufficient* for ~95% of games—especially when it funnels directly into your **win condition** (scaling, farming, invading).

### Why Full Clear Wins
- **Highest early level** (≈ level 4 at 3:15–3:30)
- Full HP/resources for **Scuttle**, **Drake**, or **Herald**
- Repeatable clears create a **tempo baseline** (≈ 9–10 CS/min in Season 15)

### Efficiency Floor
- Minimum acceptable path: **quadrant clear**  
  *(3 camps on one side → cross mid → next action)*
- Avoid paths with fewer than 3 camps unless executing a **level-2 cheese** or **forced invade**

### Situational Awareness Supremacy
- Check minimap every ~5 seconds
- Track **summoners used** (Flash, Ghost, Cleanse)
- Immediate response > theoretical pathing  
  **Full clear + information > optimized cheese**

### Enemy Tracking Foundation
- 1 jungle camp = **4 CS**
- Missing camps reveal enemy pathing  
  *(e.g., Raptors missing → bot-side full clear likely)*

**Core Evaluation Criteria:**  
Every path is judged by:
1. **Information quality** (tracking accuracy)
2. **Risk** (invade / collapse likelihood)
3. **Tempo** (on-time recall and re-entry)

## Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Lane Priority (Prio)** | A lane can push or rotate without losing CS/XP, enabling ganks, invades, and dives. |
| **Tempo** | Clear → action → recall → re-entry cycle. Full clears preserve tempo by syncing with camp respawns. No idle time >8s. |
| **Information Advantage** | Confirmed data from wards, minimap, F-keys, CS tracking, and summoner usage. Level-1 buff wards are high value. |

## Jungle Camps & Timers (Patch 15.24)

| Camp | Effect | Respawn | Notes |
|------|--------|---------|-------|
| **Blue Sentinel** | Mana + Ability Haste | 5:00 | Mana/AP champs; kite to wall |
| **Red Brambleback** | Lifesteal + AA slow | 5:00 | Strong for AD/AA kits |
| **Gromp** | Burst sustain | 2:30 | Pair with buff for efficiency |
| **Wolves** | Mixed DPS | 2:30 | Enables early level-2 spikes |
| **Raptors** | AoE value | 2:30 | XP-efficient; skippable for early ganks |
| **Krugs** | High gold density | 2:30 | Vertical farming priority |
| **Scuttle Crab** | Vision + MS shrine | 3:15 → 2:15 | Winning Scuttle often dictates early tempo |

**Starting Pets**
- **Gustwalker Hatchling** – Clear speed
- **Mosstomper Seedling** – Sustain
- **Scorchclaw Pup** – Early dueling

**Smite Upgrades (Level 5)**
- **Chilling Smite** – Gank slows
- **Challenging Smite** – Duel pressure

## Standard Full Clears (Patch 15.24)

**Target completion:** 3:15–3:30  
**Goal:** 1 Smite available for Scuttle

| Start Side | Path | Target Time | Best For |
|------------|------|-------------|----------|
| **Red Start (Bot Prio)** | Red → Krugs → Raptors → Wolves → Blue → Gromp → Scuttle | 3:15–3:25 | Farmers / Scalers (Yi, Karthus, Lillia) |
| **Blue Start (Top Prio)** | Blue → Gromp → Wolves → Raptors → Red → Krugs → Scuttle | 3:10–3:20 | Gankers (Talon, Jarvan IV, Zac) |

**Quadrant Example:**  
Bot quadrant (Red → Krugs → Raptors) → cross mid → invade enemy top quadrant.

## Champion-Specific Due Diligence

- **Do your homework:** Optimal clears vary by champion
  - u.gg stats
  - Challenger VODs (OP.GG)
  - Champion-specific spreadsheets
- **Kiting baseline:** Finish clears ≥70% HP
- **Smite usage:** Buffs and Scuttle only

### Practice Drills
1. Custom games: 10 timed full clears per champion
2. Adjust for matchup: High invade risk → safer full clear
3. VOD review: *“Was I the highest level at 3:15?”*

**Pro Edge:**  
70% HP + information advantage = reliable invade setups

## Champion Archetypes (Patch 15.24)

| Archetype | Playstyle | Meta Picks |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Farmer** | Full clear → scale / invade | Yi, Karthus, Lillia |
| **Ganker** | Level-3 pressure | Talon, Jarvan IV, Zac |
| **Duelist** | Early invades | Kha'Zix, Lee Sin |
| **Tank** | Objective control | Sejuani, Rammus |

## Why Foundations Matter

Mechanical skill plateaus around Diamond.  
**Macro clarity**—tempo control, information usage, and repeatable clears—creates Master+ separation.

Undefined terms lead to bad decisions.  
Practice F-keys, track CS gaps, and default to **full clear → win condition** as your unbreakable baseline.
