## Framework Examples

This page walks through **realistic jungle scenarios** and applies the framework step by step.

Focus on **decision quality**, not mechanical execution.

---

## Example 1: Early Game Full Clear (Rammus)

**Game state**
- Champion: Rammus
- Lanes: Neutral early
- Enemy jungler: Unknown start

**Decision**
- Full clear all 6 camps
- Ward enemy buff at level 1
- Contest Scuttle only if priority exists

**Why this works**
- Rammus scales with levels
- No information → default branch
- Preserves tempo and safety

**Framework rule applied**
> When uncertain, full clear + add vision.

---

## Example 2: Countergank Top Lane

**Game state**
- Your top laner is pushed
- Enemy jungler missing
- Herald spawning in 60 seconds

**Decision**
- Hover top-side instead of invading
- Prepare countergank
- Secure Herald after winning fight

**Why this works**
- Enemy commits first
- You gain numbers advantage
- Converts defense into objective control

**Framework rule applied**
> Counterganks convert enemy pressure into advantage.

---

## Example 3: Enemy Ganks Bot, You Are Top Side

**Game state**
- Enemy jungler shows bot
- You are clearing top quadrant
- Top lane has priority

**Decision**
- Invade enemy top camps
- Drop deep vision
- Pressure Herald or mid tower

**Why this works**
- Enemy trade is denied
- You gain gold + information
- Map remains balanced

**Framework rule applied**
> Never let the enemy jungler get value for free.

---

## Example 4: Failed Gank Mid

**Game state**
- Gank mid fails (Flash burned)
- Enemy jungler unseen
- Camps are up

**Decision**
- Do not re-gank immediately
- Return to farming
- Track Flash timer for future window

**Why this works**
- Avoids repeat failure
- Maintains tempo
- Sets up higher-probability play later

**Framework rule applied**
> A failed gank ends the branch.

## How to Practice With Examples

1. Pause your VOD at a decision point
2. Identify which framework branch applies
3. Compare your action to the example logic

Improvement comes from **pattern recognition**, not memorization.
