## Jungle Decision Framework  
**Season 15 · For Every Jungler**

A **scalable decision-making framework** for jungling in League of Legends, focused on macro, tempo, and information rather than champion-specific mechanics.

This framework is inspired by Challenger-level play (e.g., Perry, Rank 2 NA) and coaching systems, but is designed to be **approachable from Iron to Challenger**.

No prior jungle knowledge is required. The system starts with simple, repeatable actions (full clears) and scales into advanced concepts (enemy tracking, cross-map trades).

> **Patch 15.24 snapshot (Emerald+):** Rammus, Rek'Sai, Bel'Veth, and Jax remain strong performers across U.GG and Mobalytics data.

## Why This Framework Works

| Rank Range | What You Gain |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Iron–Bronze** | Clear checklists: full clear → gank pushed lanes → reduce chaos. |
| **Silver–Gold** | Pathing + tracking: predict the enemy jungler and punish mistakes. |
| **Platinum–Diamond** | Tempo control: trade objectives and pressure cross-map. |
| **Master+** | Low-variance decisions: evaluate plays by information, risk, and tempo. |

**Core Model**

> **Jungle = Clear → Action → Reset**

- One jungle camp = **4 CS**
- Full clears establish a reliable baseline
- Information and awareness outweigh mechanical optimization

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

1. **Level 1 ward** the enemy buff/ raptors to identify their start.
2. **Full clear** from Red or Blue → aim for level 6 by ~3:15.
3. **Check minimap every ~5 seconds** to track summoners and lane states.
4. **Practice once** in a custom game to time your first clear.

Executing this system consistently—even at ~80% accuracy—can result in steady, repeatable improvement over a season.
