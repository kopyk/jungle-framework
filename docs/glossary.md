## Glossary

Short, framework-aligned definitions. If a term affects a decision branch, it belongs here.

## Core Macro

**Priority (Prio)**  
Ability for a lane to move first without losing too much CS/XP/HP. Prio creates safe windows for invades, Scuttle, objectives, and dives.

**Tempo**  
How efficiently you chain actions: **Clear → Play → Reset → Re-enter**. Good tempo means you are present for spawns, fights, and objectives *on time*.

**Reset**  
Intentional recall to convert gold into stats and return to the map on a timing (usually after a clear, play, or objective).

**Cycle**  
One repeatable loop of tempo: clear a quadrant → take an action → reset → re-enter as camps/objectives spawn.

**Window**  
A short time where a play is “allowed” (enemy waves pushed, summoners down, enemy jungler seen elsewhere).

**Win Condition (Wincon)**  
The most reliable way your team wins (scale, split, teamfight, pick, snowball one lane). Your routes should serve this.

---

## Map Side Concepts

**Strong-side**  
The side of the map where you have more support (prio, winning lane, better matchup). Safer for aggressive plays.

**Weak-side**  
The side where you’re more likely to lose a 2v2/3v3 (no prio, losing lane). Prefer safer clears, cover/counterganks, or trades.

**Cross-map**  
Responding to a play on the opposite side: enemy ganks bot → you invade top / take Herald / pressure tower.

**Trade**  
Giving something up but taking something else immediately (Drake ↔ Herald, kills ↔ camps, pressure ↔ vision).

---

## Information & Vision

**Tracking**  
Predicting enemy jungler location using wards, last seen, camp timers, lane states, and CS.

**CS Tracking (Jungle)**  
Jungle camps count as **4 CS** each. A sudden +8 CS often indicates two camps taken.

**Deep Ward**  
A ward placed inside enemy jungle to reveal routes (raptors, wolves, entrances). Used to “make information” when path is unknown.

**Sweep / Clearing Vision**  
Removing wards to create uncertainty and safe paths for invades or objectives.

**Information Advantage**  
You know where they are (or aren’t). This makes risky plays become safe plays.

---

## Pathing & Clearing

**Full Clear**  
Taking all 6 camps on one side-to-side route before first major play. Default when uncertain.

**3-Camp Path (Level 3 Path)**  
Taking 3 camps to hit level 3 quickly and attempt a high-probability gank or invade (only if setup exists).

**Quadrant**  
One side of the jungle: three camps + the adjacent buff area (top/bot “half” of your jungle).

**Sequencing**  
The order you clear camps to maximize time, health, and map presence.

**Leash**  
A laner helping the jungler at the first buff. You can often infer enemy start from who arrives late to lane.

**Vertical Jungling**  
You take enemy camps on one side while they take yours on the other. Common when one side becomes unsafe.

---

## Plays & Reactions

**Gank**  
A coordinated lane attack. High-probability ganks usually require: wave state + ally follow-up (CC/damage) + enemy vulnerability.

**Countergank**  
You arrive to a lane where the enemy gank is about to happen and turn the fight. Often higher value than forcing a proactive gank.

**Hover / Cover**  
Positioning near a lane to discourage dives/ganks or to be ready to counter. You’re not committing—just threatening presence.

**Dive**  
Killing under tower. Requires wave crash, health, cooldowns, and typically numbers advantage.

**Invade**  
Entering enemy jungle to steal camps, force a fight, or place vision. “Allowed” when you have info + prio + survivable exit.

**Overstay**  
Remaining on the map too long with unspent gold/low HP, causing you to lose tempo and die to collapses.

---

## Objectives & Control

**Scuttle (Rift Scuttler)**  
Early vision/river control objective. Contest only when you have support (prio) or enemy jungler is known elsewhere.

**Voidgrubs**  
Early objective that rewards tower pressure. Often traded against Drake depending on lanes and tempo.

**Herald**  
Objective for tower damage and plate gold. Usually tied to top/mid priority.

**Drake**  
Scaling objective. Often “allowed” when bot/mid can move and you have vision control.

**Setup**  
Vision + wave states + position created *before* starting an objective. Most objective losses happen because setup was skipped.

**50/50**  
Starting an objective without control where both junglers can Smite contest. Avoid unless you must flip.

---

## Lane/Wave Terms (Jungle-Relevant)

**Pushed Lane**  
Enemy is advanced toward your tower. Often gankable *if* your laner can help.

**Crashing**  
A large wave hitting tower. Common dive window because the wave denies CS if the enemy dies/recalls.

**Lane Volatility**  
How likely a lane is to fight soon (low HP, stacked wave, ignite/flash down, aggressive matchup). Volatile lanes are countergank targets.

---

## Resource Management

**Gold Conversion**  
The idea that gold in your inventory is weaker than items on the map. Resets convert gold into stats.

**Power Spike**  
A timing where your champion gets much stronger (level 6, first item, upgraded Smite). Use spikes to choose aggressive branches.

**Summoner Window**  
A period where Flash/Heal/Cleanse are down and a lane becomes much easier to punish.

---

## Framework Phrases

**“Allowed” Play**  
A play that passes the checklist: info + prio + state (HP/items) + exit.

**“Never free value”**  
If the enemy gets something (kills/objective), you should immediately seek a trade (camps/tower/other objective/vision).

**Info → Risk → Tempo**  
A priority order for decision quality: confirm what’s happening, choose the safest high-value option, then preserve timing.
